## Notes

One of the main challenges was working with JavaScript array methods like .filter(), .reduce(), and .forEach() to manipulate and display data dynamically. Debugging logic errors also proved tricky at times. Implementing features like the search bar required extra attention to case sensitivity and ensuring user input matched game titles reliably. Additionally, dynamically creating and updating DOM elements while responding to user interactions (like filters and searches) took careful structuring to avoid bugs and ensure a smooth user experience.
